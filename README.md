# Smash The Alarm
This repository features an Android alarm clock app in development,
as ordered by Ofer "The Duke" Waldman in exchange for 4 points.

*Oh yeah baby, those sweet sweet points will be mine* (≖ ͜ʖ≖)

## The Plan
The app shall be aimed to be a copy of the default Android alarm clock,
except for two major differences:
1. The alarm clock shall not stop ringing until the user "smashes it" by solving a riddle or a mathematical equation.
2. The alarm ringtone shall be the [Aggretsuko opening theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9jGaJJlNyo), and the user shall not be able to change it.

## Contribute
Now seems like a good time to note that I have absolutely no previous experience in Android development whatsoever.
Additionally, I have other stuff to work on.
With that said, any kind of contribution is appreciated.

If you really want to, you can just continue the development while I'm busy.
Take a look at the [tasks list](https://github.com/PaperBag42/SmashTheAlarmClock#tasks) to see what is not done yet.
We can even share the points, although it will be hard for me to give them up :'(

In case you have your own life as well, you can still help by saving me some [Google searches](https://github.com/PaperBag42/SmashTheAlarmClock#things-i-will-have-to-google-at-some-point),
or just giving me some tips if you have any.

Also I really need the actual Aggretsuko soundtrack (not just the Youtube clip)

This thing already exists, it's called Alarmy.
Motivation went from 100 to 0.
You can do whatever you want with this now, I don't care anymore
